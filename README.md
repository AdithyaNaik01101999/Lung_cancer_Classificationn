# Lung_cancer_Classificationn
PulmoDetect is a deep learning project for lung cancer detection using CNNs (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNetB7) on chest X-rays and CT scans. EfficientNetB7 achieved 89.55% accuracy, outperforming others. Implemented with Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, it enhances early diagnosis, improving accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility in medical imaging.
Here is a **neat and professional project overview** you can add to your GitHub `README.md` file for your **Lung Cancer Classification** project:

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview: Lung Cancer Image Classification

This project focuses on the **automated classification of lung cancer** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **transfer learning techniques**. It aims to assist medical professionals by providing a fast and accurate second opinion through image-based diagnostics.

We use a curated dataset of lung CT scans categorized into **Benign**, **Malignant**, and **Normal** classes. The goal is to build a deep learning model that can learn patterns from these medical images and accurately predict the presence and type of lung abnormality.

### ðŸ”¬ Key Highlights:

* Preprocessing and augmentation to improve data balance and model generalization
* Implementation of popular transfer learning models: **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, and **EfficientNetB7**
* Evaluation using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **ROC-AUC**
* Visualization of training performance, confusion matrices, and classification results
* Comparison of multiple model architectures to determine the best-performing one

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

To develop an intelligent image classification system capable of distinguishing between healthy lung images and various lung cancer types, enabling faster diagnosis and potential integration into healthcare workflows.
